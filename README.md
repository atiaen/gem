**GEM**

Welcome to Gem. A mini Genetic Algorithm Framework, I made for a course I'm doing for my masters degree.

It currently works for string based GA's only right now but I will probably be expanded to numbers later on.

This document might get updated later but right now. I'm just storing it on my repo.
